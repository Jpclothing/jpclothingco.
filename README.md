About Juan Pelaez

I’m Juan Pelaez, founder of JP Clothing Co.
The idea began at my church, where I saw many men who wanted to dress with confidence but didn’t know where to start.
I created JP Clothing Co. to help men feel comfortable and refined, whether in everyday wear or the active line, JP Active.
